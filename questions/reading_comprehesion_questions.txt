Subject: My watch

Dear Coach Harris,

At basketball practice today, I took off my watch. I always put it in my bag before practice because I don’t want to break it. However, my watch wasn’t in my bag when I got home! I need it tomorrow afternoon because I’ll take a test. Did I leave my watch in the gym?

Thank you,
Amy
